# Issues Detected
From a quick exploratory data analysis (EDA) there were some issues detected in the dataset:
- All columns had null values. 'params' column had 91,72 % of null values
- Also params column contais dictionaries with 4 keys 'apartment', 'apartments', 'page', 'requests'
- Timestamp column has unexcpected formats (3 types)

# Proposals
- Return to the source where this parquet file is created and try to understand why these null values exist. Afterwards try to solve the issue.
- In the pipeline fix the dictionary as 4 new columns
- Fix the timstamp formats during the data pipeline or return to the source
- Replace null values to event_type, user_country, user_agent, page_country, env with value 'Unknown'
- Fic session_ids that are null , insert values of session_id of other rows that have the same user_agent.
