# Issues Detected
From a quick exploratory data analysis (EDA) there were some issues detected in the dataset:
- All columns had null values. 'params' column had 91,72 % of null values
- Also params column contais dictionaries with 4 keys 'apartment', 'apartments', 'page', 'requests'

# Proposals
- Return to the source where this parquet file is created and try to understand why these null values exist. Afterwards try to solve the issue.
-In the pipeline fix the dictionary as 4 new columns
